Problem 15
Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.


How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?
"""


"""
Answer:
combination(20 + 20 , 20)

for each row, can go down or right (20 + 20). 
   There are 20 rows, so therefore, 20 variations.
